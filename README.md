# NEAKSS (VEX 2017-2018)

Vex In the Zone 2018 team including Alessandro EB, Ethan M, Kelly X, Nathan B, Sienna BP and Sushrut R

Code written by Nathan B


Message to team members for Wednesday:

Download ROBOTC for VEX EDR onto a Windows machine (you'll need to set up an account), download the code in the "Revised" folder, then put all the code files into one folder. Don't modify any code other than "autonomous1.c". Download "composite.c" to the robot when you're ready to test. If you're having trouble with downloading it to the robot, try updating the firmware, then downloading it again.


Please don't experiment with the remote controls program...
