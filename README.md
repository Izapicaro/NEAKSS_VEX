Code written by Nathan B





Message to team members for Wednesday:

Download ROBOTC for VEX EDR onto a Windows machine (you'll need to set up an account), download the code in the "Revised" folder, then put all the code files into one folder.

>>>PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE APART FROM "autonomous1.c"<<<

Download "composite.c" to the robot (while it's switched off) when you're ready to test. Ignore any alerts and close any popup windows.If you're having trouble with downloading it to the robot, try updating the firmware, then downloading it again.

Once you've downloaded the program to the robot, uplug it from the computer and connect it to the remote (leave it switched off). Switch on the VEX Cortex and once there are green lights flashing on the remote, press 7U to run autonomous strategy 1, 7D for autonomous strategy 2 and 7R to skip to the remote control. You will need to re-download the code to the robot every time you want to run either autonomous strategy.

Do not switch on the remote unless you're testing out wireless, in which case ask Team 2 for advice. You might also want to ask them how to use two remote controls. The code for using two remote controls has not been tested yet, so if it doesn't work just ignore it.
